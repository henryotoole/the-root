		This very website runs on an aging computer named Tombstone. Tombstone sits on my desk next to my 3D printer and is mostly responsible for running servers. Primarily I use it as a file server and to host this website, but occasionally I'll use it for other types of servers. Most servers operate via the command line, which is wonderful because I can SSH into Tombstone from nearly anywhere and mess with them. However, often I'll find myself needing to make some change to a server when I'm away from a computer with only my phone to access the world with. I don't know if you've ever attempted to use command line via SSH on a mobile phone, but it's pretty miserable. <br><br>
		
		That's why I'm launching this project. It's goal will be to provide a more mobile-friendly interface layer for some of the servers I run. I'll be primarily developing this in python, which will be built into the Flask backend of this website. For starters I'll attempt to control a Minecraft server with this code, but in the future I hope to hook this to some sort of control software for my 3D printer.

		Here's a link to the project interface itself. You'll need admin access to make any changes, but anyone should be able to view things like status.
